# FARM interventions to Control Antimicrobial ResistancE (**FARM-CARE**)

In this project, we have utilized an AI-based framework for **automated, non-invasive stress detection** in sows using facial images and deep learning.  
This repository includes code, data samples, notebooks, and documentation for:

- **Study 1:** Stress classification within one generation  
- **Study 2:** Cross-generation evaluation (training on parents, testing on offspring) *(in progress)*

---

## Project Motivation

Livestock stress impacts animal welfare, productivity, and farm economics. Traditional stress assessment methods are manual, subjective, and time-consuming. Our method uses facial region analysis and deep learning to enable reliable, repeatable, and real-time stress classification in sows.

---

## Methodology

### **Data Collection**

- Images of sows from multiple cameras covering different angles.

---

### **Preprocessing**

- Image Labelling using **Segment Anything**
- Automatic facial detection and cropping using **YOLOv8**
- Pig eye-based image filtering using **YOLOv3-Tiny**
- Redundant image filter using **VGG16**

### **Models**

- Image augmentation and filtering during training to improve data quality.
- Pre-trained deep learning models: **ConvNeXt, EfficientNetV2, MobileNetV3, RegNet, and Vision Transformer (ViT)**.
- Fine-tuned for stress classification.

---

### **Experiments**

- **Within-generation:** Train/test on same generation (12 sows) using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) approach.
- **Cross-generation:** Train on 12 parent sows, test on their 48 offspring to assess model generalization.

---

### **Performance Metrics**

- Accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix.

---

## Key Results

- **High classification accuracy** with Vision Transformers (ViT).
- Robust detection with various data augmentation settings.
- Promising cross-generation results, showing potential for practical deployment.

## Findings

The Vision Transformer model (ViT) emerged as the most effective architecture for classifying stress states in sows, consistently outperforming other models across multiple evaluation batches. It achieved the highest average accuracy of **0.75**, with an F1-score of **0.78** overall, and performed particularly well in identifying high-stressed sows — achieving up to **0.88 F1-score** in its best-performing batch.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the training and testing workflows:

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/FARM-CARE.git
cd FARM-CARE
```

---

### Prepare Input Data

- Your input images should be listed in **CSV or Excel** files.
- The **first column** must contain the **Path** (image path).
- The **second column** must contain the **Condition** (corresponding label 0/1).

---

### Run Training

```bash
# Navigate to the training directory
cd Training_Parents

# Run the training script
python Train_Parent_Data.py
```

---

### Run Testing

```bash
# Navigate to the testing directory
cd Testing_Parents

# Run the testing script
python Test_Parent_Data.py
```

---

## Notes

Make sure your image paths in your CSV/Excel files are correct and relative to your project folder.

Install all dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
